Private Relay is a privacy-preserving TCP proxy‚Äîessentially [HAProxy][haproxy] in `mode tcp`‚Äîthat facilitates IP anonymization when routing multiple clients traffic through it.

[See the GitHub repository for more context ‚Üí](https://git.privaterelay.technology)

As a quick example of the functionality, `relay.privaterelay.technology` runs this image with the default config:

```bash
curl -sSL 'https://httpbin.org/ip' | jq '.origin'
# => $ADDRESS1
curl -sSL --connect-to httpbin.org:443:relay.privaterelay.technology:443 'https://httpbin.org/ip' | jq '.origin'
# => $ADDRESS2
```

Note that `$ADDRESS1` ‚â† `$ADDRESS2`. ü•≥

## How to use this image

This image is the base `haproxy` image with a custom config‚Äî[please see the upstream documentation as well](https://hub.docker.com/_/haproxy).

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with a set of backend servers:

```tf
backends = [
  {
    name = "example"
    host = "example.com"
    port = "443"
  },
]
```

Note: this is [HCL][]. [You can also use JSON by creating a `terraform.tfvars.json` file instead.][1]

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use this as a base image, `COPY terraform.tfvars /app/`, and `RUN /app/build-config`:

```Dockerfile
FROM privaterelay/privaterelay
COPY terraform.tfvars /app/
RUN /app/build-config
```

Terraform generates the config file from the set of backends specified.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Start your container:

```bash
docker run --rm --detach --publish 8080:443 --name private-relay private-relay
```

HAProxy is now running on the host's `:8080`.
